    This class is to be used as the permission class for API `Views`/`ViewSets`.
    In combination with the `OrganizationPermissionsMixin`, permission checking
    will be done to ensure the user has the correct permissions to perform the
    CRUD operation.

    **Note:** If the user is not authenticated, they will be denied access
    globally.

    Permissions are broken down into two areas:
    
    - `Tenancy` Objects

        This object requires that the user have the correct permission and that
        permission be assigned within the organiztion the object belongs to.

    - `Non-Tenancy` Objects.

        This object requires the the use have the correct permission assigned,
        regardless of the organization the object is from. This includes objects
        that have no organization.
