## Ansible Automation Platform / AWX

We have built an [Ansible Collection](../../ansible/collection/centurion/index.md) for Centurion ERP that you could consider the bridge between the config within Centurion and the end device. This collection can be directly added to AAP / AWX as a project which enables accessing the features the collection has to offer. Please refer to the [collections documentation](../../ansible/collection/centurion/index.md) for further information.
